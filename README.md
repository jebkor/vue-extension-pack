# Vue VSCode Extension Pack

A collection of the extensions that I use in my day-to-day development in VSCode. Heavily configured towards Vue.js development


## Extensions included
[Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag): There is nothing worse than having to update the end-tag of an element, *after* your page doesn't work, because of an unclosed tag - this extension helps mitigating that

[Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify): Formats your JSON, CSS, Sass and HTML

[Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments): An extension for making comments more visible by color-coding them, depending on importance

[Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer): Having difficulty determining which bracket closes which? This extension colorizes the brackets to make it easier for you to identify the correct pair

[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker): Not much to it - helps you with correct spelling of words, even camelCased words.

[HTMLHint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkaufman.HTMLHint): Having the editor tell us that our HTML could be faulty before we get a document error, is a nice addition

[JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets): Because making ES6 more available is a great idea!
